# Agent 3.0.0 release notes 

Agent release 3.0.0 is published! This release requires a small amount of action from you.

## Set up a fresh agent instance
As always with new contract deployments, we highly recommend to create a new agent instance as described in the README.
Run both instances at least 24h simultaneously in order to let the agent withdraw the outstanding funds from the old version.

## Adding Base
With this version we are supporting Base as a new rollup.

* Add Base as a chain to you agent.conf
* Add the token addresses for Base (lines with chain id `8453`) to your tokens
* Fund your account on Base

## Tear down old agent instance
When your agent has withdrawn all outstanding funds, you can stop your agent via

```sh
docker compose down
```
