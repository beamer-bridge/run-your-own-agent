# Agent 2.4.0 release notes 

Agent release 2.4.0 is published! This release requires a small amount of action from you.

## New deployment files
We have slightly adjusted the artifact files

run 

`rm -rf /data/dist/`


You can download the new files with

```
curl -sSfL https://registry.npmjs.org/@beamer-bridge/deployments/-/deployments-2.0.2.tgz |
     tar xz -C data --strip-components=1 package/dist
```

Please run this command inside of the ROOT folder of your `run-your-own-agent` project.

You will see now a new file structure like

```
./data/dist/artifacts/mainnet
./data/dist/abis/mainnet
```

The `artifacts` directory contains all the information about the deployed contracts.
The `abis` directory contains the necessary ABIs of the contracts.


## Adding Polygon zkEVM
With this version we are supporting Polygon zkEVM as a new rollup.

* Add Polygon as a chain to you agent.conf as in https://github.com/beamer-bridge/run-your-own-agent/blob/ac5180c70ae6983e77e5bf3880bc349c8fe19959/data/agent-mainnet.conf#L28
* Add the token addresses for Polygon (lines with chain id `1101`) to your tokens like in https://github.com/beamer-bridge/run-your-own-agent/blob/main/data/agent-mainnet.conf#L43-L66
* fund your account on Polygon

## Update as always

`image: ghcr.io/beamer-bridge/beamer:v2.4.0`

```sh
docker compose down
